About Me Website

## Installation
The content is available over the internet and does not require installation of any sort.

## Usage
The website is designed with multi-device support and navigation in mind. With that being said, we can start at the top of the page. 
Top Left: Contains "Home" link disguised as my name "Robert Sunde". Also contains quick links to individual pages.
Top Right: Contains nothing unless screen reaches smaller width. If it reaches this width it contains an expandable menu containing quick links.
Middle Bottom: Home to a floating footer that contains links to social media.
